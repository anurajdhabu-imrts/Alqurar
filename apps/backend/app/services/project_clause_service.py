"""Per-project Clause Library store — backed by the database.

Each project has its OWN clause library, built from that project's uploaded
contract. Today rows are added/edited/deleted manually by the analyst; they
survive restarts. When the Anthropic key is enabled, an extraction step writes
AI-detected clauses into this same table (scoped by projectId) and nothing else
changes. Function names mirror the global clause_service so the API layer is
familiar.
